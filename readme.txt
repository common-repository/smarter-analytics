Smarter Analytics is a better way to add Google Analytics to your WordPress installation.

== Description ==

Add multiple Google Analytics codes to your WordPress installation and apply them on a per-page/per-post basis. Global defaults for posts and pages can be configured and overridden on an individual basis. Smarter Analytics settings allow you to exclude tracking on logged-in users and specified IPs to keep your Analytics reporting accurate without the hassle of complex filtering.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the files to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Update your settings on the 'Settings -> Smarter Analytics' settings page.
4. You're done! Google Analytics will be added to your WordPress installation.

== Screenshots ==

1. Add your Google Analytics codes and set defaults for the entire site, or just for pages and posts. You can also excluded user roles and specific users from being included in your analytics.
2. You can also exclude IPs and IP ranges from tracking.
3. When editing a page, you can set a different tracking code for that specific page. You can also choose not to include a tracking code at all.
4. When a user is included in an exclusion policy, Smarter Analytics will tell you why so you don't have to guess.
